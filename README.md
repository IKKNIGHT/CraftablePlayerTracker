**Description:**

To track a player using a compass, right-click on the compass to open a GUI. From there, you can select which player you want to track. If you want to change the player you're tracking, simply hold the Shift key and then right-click again. 

**Crafting Recipe:**

To craft the tracking compass, place a compass in the middle of the crafting grid with a Wither Skeleton Skull on top and one on the bottom, as shown below:

```
XWX
XCX
XWX
```

'X' represents empty spaces (air), 'C' represents the Compass, and 'W' represents Wither Skeleton Skulls.

**Commands:**

Use the command `/ptcompass` to give the player a compass (requires OP privileges).
